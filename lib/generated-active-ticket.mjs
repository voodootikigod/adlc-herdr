// The active-ticket pointer contract. This module is the ONE definition of how
// `.adlc/current-ticket.json` is read, and it is copied verbatim into every
// harness by the generator (spec §14) so no harness hand-rolls its own resolver
// again. `packages/tickets/test/pointer.test.mjs` runs every copy over one
// shared vector table and fails if any of them disagree.
//
// It returns a discriminated result rather than throwing: hooks want to branch,
// and staying free of the domain's error classes is what lets this file be
// generated into a harness that cannot resolve @adlc/tickets. `provenance.mjs`
// adapts these results back into TicketStoreError for the domain API.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT. If the file exists and parses to an object, the outcome
// is resolve or deny — never "no active ticket". Treating a shape we do not
// understand as "no pointer" is a fail-OPEN hole in a trust root: it silently
// disables enforcement. Deactivation is deleting the file, not writing `{}`.

// Sentinel distinguishing "genuinely absent" (ENOENT on the pointer path itself,
// with a real parent directory — the only legitimate "no active ticket" case)

// failure (null) so the caller fails CLOSED rather than treating it as absence.
const ABSENT = Symbol('pointer-absent');

// Read up to MAX_POINTER_BYTES of a REGULAR file without blocking. The pointer
// root can be untrusted (issue #341: a harness may resolve it from an event
// payload), so:
//
// 1. The PARENT directory (.adlc) is lstat-checked first and must itself be a
//    real directory, never a symlink: O_NOFOLLOW on the final open below only
//    protects the LAST path component, so an attacker able to replace `.adlc`
//    itself with a symlink to an external directory could otherwise redirect
//    the read even though the leaf file's own no-follow open "succeeds"
//    (agy cross-model review, round 7). This narrows — Node's fs module has no
//    public FD-relative/openat() binding, which this Node-built-ins-only file
//    cannot assume exists, so a walk like this cannot be made fully atomic
//    against a parent directory replaced in the exact gap between this check
//    and the open below — but it closes the STATIC case (the parent already
//    swapped before this function runs), which is the realistic threat: an
//    attacker able to win a microsecond race on top of that would already need
//    a degree of concurrent local access this reader's threat model (a single
//    untrusted pointer FILE, not a compromised filesystem) does not otherwise
//    assume.
// 2. lstatSync on the pointer path ITSELF, not just O_NOFOLLOW on the open
//    (cross-platform finding, mirrors @adlc/gate-manifest/lib/lineage.mjs and
//    @adlc/tickets/lib/manifest-segments.mjs's readBoundedJsonNoFollow exactly):
//    O_NOFOLLOW's enforcement is not portable — Windows CI showed a symlinked
//    marker silently followed elsewhere in this repo, since O_NOFOLLOW is not
//    reliably honored there (Windows symlinks are reparse points, handled
//    differently than POSIX symlinks by Node's fs layer). lstatSync + isFile()
//    is a portable, OS-independent check that rejects a symlink OR an oversized
//    pointer outright — a caller must never treat a truncated-but-parseable
//    prefix (valid JSON followed by padding; JSON.parse ignores trailing
//    whitespace) as a legitimate, unmodified pointer (round 6: a hand-rolled
//    caller-side lstat check left a race between it and a separate open call —
//    closing it here, once, for every harness). This ALSO replaces the old
//    top-level existsSync(path) absence check in readActiveTicketPointer:
//    existsSync FOLLOWS symlinks, so a DANGLING symlink at the pointer path
//    (pointing at a nonexistent target) used to read as "genuinely absent" —
//    present:false, ok:true — silently disabling enforcement entirely rather
//    than failing closed on a present-but-untrustworthy pointer (round 7).
// 3. O_NOFOLLOW stays on the open for its atomicity where it IS honored, and the
//    post-open fstat re-verifies type and size on the OPENED fd (a path swap
//    after a successful open cannot matter; the fd is bound to the inode) —
//    the final, authoritative check regardless of what the open actually
//    resolved to.
//
// Returns the text, ABSENT for a genuinely missing pointer with a real parent
// directory, or null for a symlink (at the pointer path OR its parent), a
// non-regular file, an oversized file, or any other error; the caller fails
// CLOSED on null (never on ABSENT — that is the one legitimate "no active
// ticket" outcome).
